To evaluate the practical effectiveness of CMGs in mitigating oscillations, a specialized experimental setup named GROOVE (Gyroscopically Regulated Oscillation Observation and
Verification Equipment) was designed and developed. The experimental hardware intentionally excluded flying components, such as rotors, focusing solely on investigating the impact
of CMGs.
